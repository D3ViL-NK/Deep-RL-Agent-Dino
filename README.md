# RLDino
So this must be easy eh!
A RL model to play Dino game on chrome.
But this is just the Draft the model is not accurate enough.
The target was to make an python file to extract the image data and feed it in to the model and also to take action depending on the pridiction by the model.
### This is not the final code :)
